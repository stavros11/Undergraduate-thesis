# Undergraduate-thesis
The text of my undergraduate thesis conducted in the year 2016-17 at the University of Athens. The idea was to gather information 
related to the SYK model from different sources and present this modern subject
of theoretical physics in a simple way, ideally understandable by undergraduate students. No original work is included in this thesis.
